        I was the MC! I was absent when they were choosing the MCs, I just suddenly found out 
        that I was part of it. We invited multiple teachers, but only Miss Dancal and Miss Jo could attend.

      <h1>Historical Icon</h1>
      <p>
        We chose to represent Amelia Earhart as our historical icon figure. Our classmate, Angel 
        Santos, was the one who represented Fidelity for this competition. She won second place!

    <div class="content" id="booklandia">
      <h1>Booklandia</h1>
      <p>
        It's an event that the English club hosted in which we can bring the book characters we 
        like to life! Since there was another competition for this, the class elected our president 
        and vice president for this. They represented the God of Sun and Moon, in which they won 
        second place as well. WOOP! FIDELITY WIN STREAK!

        The gallery contains 3 categories - photos, videos, and audio.

        I learned how to modify my webpage with the use of Cascading Stylesheets (CSS).  
        I still don't fully understand how it works since I'm having trouble navigating through the attributes and different styles that I can use.  
        I find difficulties using stylesheets since I keep forgetting how classes and IDs work.  
        Somehow, while making this portfolio, I've managed to apply the things that I have learned.  
        It isn't great at the moment, but I am trying my best to improve my work.
